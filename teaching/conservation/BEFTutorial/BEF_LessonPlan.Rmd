## Spiel

We want species around so we can support ecosystem functioning - more diverse, species-rich communities support more ecological functions

Much debate, then supported by small experimental plots that differ by SR of plots (monocultures to 14 different species)

If species occupy diff niches, when you put them together the ecosystem in the plot = max niche usage = carbon fixed through photosynthesis, plant growth

More takeup/utilization of resources = more biomass 
Measure of ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION, often in g of carbon/m2

Slide 1:
Saturating relationship (e.g. N being removed from the soil, plateaus)

We would expect this to level out - 7 or 8 represents that there are 7 or 8 unique niches. 
Maximum niches? Could be a way of indicating the dimensions of that ONE NICHE (1-D niche space)

More species = competing for the same resource, fewer allows for species to find their own unique niche space

2 explanations:

1. Occupancy of niche space - species better cover the total niche space, each circle = occupancy in niche space (multiple dimensions)

2. Selection effect - species with higher than average monoculture yields dominate the mixture (aka. sampling effect) --> due to chance 

Lots of debate over which method is true - there always seemed to be a tend towards higher productivity in more speciose communities

Papers by mathematicians realized you can partition the variation in productivity into these two components - quantify what proportion can be attributed to complementarity and selection 
Complementarity = species yields higher than the average monoculture yield

Now what if we turn this on its head, so we're losing species instead of gaining them:

1. Rivet hypothesis - ecosystems seem okay for a time, but there's some species that keeps it all together; at some point the wings fall off but we don't know which rivets are important (e.g. planetary boundaries, tipping point - where is it, how do we know?)

2. Drivers and passengers more like the driver/passenger effect - keystone species idea; more productive systems more likely to sample species with high functioning

Varies across space, and across ecosystem types (e.g. Greece - water limitation)

Different shapes:

1. Rivet hypothesis
2. Catastrophic loss - every species is critical, removing one of those 'cogs' makes the system ineffective (**different trophic levels tend to show different relationships**)
3. Proportional - complementarity effect 

## Exercise

The purpose of this tutorial is to investigate how the **species richness** of plant communities influences the **average biomass produced** by those communities.

What ecological process can best explain that model?

## Setting up the analysis

### Set the working directory 

We need to tell R where to find the BEF files.
This is possible by changing the **working directory**, the location on your computer's file system where R will run commands.

```{r setup, include=F, eval=TRUE}
# NOTE FOR FUTURE: This HAS TO BE NAMED r setup!!!

library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(root.dir = "~/Documents/Teaching/416_Spring19/Tutorials/BEFTutorial/")
```

_Hint: Try using Tab to autocomplete the file path - this is helpful if you don't know exactly what your folders are named_. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# For Unix (MacOS and Linux), it's safe to start from your home directory:
setwd("~/Documents/Teaching/416_Spring19/Tutorials/BEFTutorial/")

# For Windows users, it's safest to start at the C: drive and go from there:
setwd("C:/...")
```

### Load the csv 

```{r}
bef.data <- read.csv("BEF2.csv", header=TRUE)
```

Notice that we provide a new argument to this `read.csv()` call that we didn't use last week: `header = TRUE`. If we look at the csv file, notice that the first line contains column names. 

When we first read in the csv, we can tell R to assign column names to the data frame based on the first row of data in the csv file. 

### Examine the BEF data

Let's take a look at the data we just read into R. 
```{r}
head(bef.data)
```

We can see that our data frame contains columns for: 

- years of observations
- a plot ID (for each unique sample plot)
- each species, where the presence of that species is indicated with a `1`; absence with a `0`
   - There are 17 possible species listed in columns 3 to 20

```{r}
colnames(bef.data)[3:20]
```

## Analysis Overview

To determine if there is a significant relationship between species richness and biomass production in plant communities:

   a) Calculate richness and mean biomass in each community
   b) Run a linear regression of both: 
   $$Biomass \sim m * Richness + b$$ 
   $$Biomass \sim m * ln(Richness) + b$$
   ...where $m$ is the coefficient/slope for $Richness$ and $b$ is the y-intercept of the linear regression.
   
   c) Interpret and plot the results of (b)
   
## Step-by-step instructions

### The first plot - calculate SR and biomass

1. Start with just one plot, `X2`. Create a data frame that contains only the observations for that one plot with `subset()`:

```{r, include = T}
sub.data<-subset(bef.data,Plot=='X2')
```

2. Count how many species are in that plot. There are a couple ways you could do this:

    a. Create a new data frame that only includes species with a `1` in the observation table, then count the number of species columns in that data frame

```{r}
# Isolate the species in the list
species <- sub.data[,3:20]

# Find the species present
spp <- colnames(species)[species[1,]==1]
species.richness <- length(spp)
```

    b. Sum across each row to get species richness in each year
```{r}
# Isolate the species in the list
species <- sub.data[,3:20]

# Sum across (the first year, all years have the same SR)
species.richness <- sum(species[1,])
```

3. Calculate the average biomass (mean across years) in each plot

```{r}
mean.biomass <- mean(sub.data$AbvBioAnnProd)
```

### Iterate over all plots with a `for` loop

4. We could repeat steps 1-3 for all plots one-at-a-time, but we can use a programming technique called loops to automatically apply the code we wrote for the first plot to all plots in the study. 

    a. Create a data frame to store the final results in
  
```{r}
# First, create a list of all plots

plots <- unique(bef.data$Plot)

plot.data <- data.frame(
  plot = plots,
  richness = NA,
  biomass = NA
)
```

    b. Write a for loop that calculates SR and biomass for each plot individually, then put the results into the data results data frame

```{r}
# Just like the code above, but tucked within a for loop
for(i in 1:length(plots)){
  p <- plots[i]
  plot.subset <- subset(bef.data, Plot==p)
  plot.species <- plot.subset[,3:20]
  
  # Calculate species richness at the start of the time series
  plot.sr <- sum(plot.species[1,])
  
  # Calculate mean biomass across the time series
  plot.biomass <- mean(plot.subset$AbvBioAnnProd)
  
  plot.data[i,"richness"] <- plot.sr
  plot.data[i,"biomass"] <- plot.biomass
}
```

### Linear regressions and plotting

5. Construct and interpret a linear model that looks at:

    a. Biomass as a function of species richness
```{r}
model <- lm(biomass ~ richness, data = plot.data)
summary(model)
```
    b. Biomass as a function of ln-transformed species richness
```{r, error=T}
# This will result in an error:
model.log <- lm(biomass ~ log(richness), data = plot.data)
```

The error here is because we are trying to take the natural logarithm of 0, which results in infinity. 
You can't regress against infinity, so we need to only select those plots that have at least 1 species in it
```{r}
which(plot.data$richness == 0) # Five sites have no species
plot.data.log <- subset(plot.data, richness > 0)
```
```{r}
model.log <- lm(biomass ~ log(richness), data = plot.data.log)
summary(model.log)
```


6. Plot each of these relationships
```{r}
plot(x = plot.data$richness, 
     y = plot.data$biomass, 
     ylab = "Biomass (g/m2)",
     xlab = "Species richness")
abline(model)
```

```{r}
plot(x = log(plot.data.log$richness), 
     y = plot.data.log$biomass, 
     ylab = "Biomass (g/m2)",
     xlab = "ln(Species Richness)")
abline(model.log)
```

7. Interpret these relationships - what do the coefficients and intercepts tell us about species richness and how it influences biomass production?

### Comparing models with R2

8. Compare the ability of the ln-transformed and untransformed species richness to predict biomass production. 

**Hint: you can do this by considering the `Multiple R-squared` object in our linear model.**

R2 is a measure of how much variation in the data is not explained by the linear relationship we just made.
It tells us how much information about $y$, in this case `biomass`, can be explained if we know what $x$, `richness`, is. 

$$r^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{reg}}{SS_{tot}}$$

![Here's a visual example](https://d2jmvrsizmvf4x.cloudfront.net/Yf5q7liBRKrDmFPk2PWA_Fit%2520of%2520linear%2520regression.gif)

A higher R2 means that more of the variation we see in biomass can be attributed to that measure of richness, so we can say that the mathematical relationship with a higher R2 is a stronger description of what's going on in these study plots.
