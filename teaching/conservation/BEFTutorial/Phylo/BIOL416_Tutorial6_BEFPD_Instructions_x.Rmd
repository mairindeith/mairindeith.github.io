In this week's tutorial, we will calculate phylogenetic diversity in each sample plot of the plant community dataset introduced last week. 
Then, we will consider how well two different measures of biodiversity - species richness, calculated last week, and phylogenetic diversity - predict the average aboveground biomass produced in the experimental plots.

Like last week, we will be working with a dataset that includes annual observations of experimental plots. 
Data include each plot's above-ground biomass and a record of which species make up its plant community.  
The same .csv file, **BEF2.csv**, which can be downloaded from Canvas in the Tutorial 5 folder.

Try to follow these steps on your own first, but don't worry if you get stuck. 
Intermittently through the tutorial, we will go through the analysis as a class. 

## Instructions

### BEF analysis: Review from last week

**If you did not finish last week's instructions, go back and finish those steps first!**

This week picks up from last week and requires that code to be up-and-running before you can start this week's analysis. Following last week's tutorial and instruction set, you should already have code that can do the following:

1. Calculate species richness and average aboveground biomass (**AAB**) for each experimental plot in the study - this requires a functional `for(...)` loop! 
2. Plot the relationship between species richness and AAB across communities in a scatterplot.
3. Run two linear regressions, $AAB \sim Richness$ and $AAB \sim ln(Richness)$, and compare their results using summary statistics from the model object. 

### BEF analysis: Phylogenetic diversity

Last week we investigated whether species richness was a significant predictor of a plant's community above-ground biomass production. 
This week, we are considering a different facet of biodiversity: **phylogenetic diversity, PD**. 
Specifically, we want to see if PD is a *better* predictor of biomass production than species richness. 

If you need a review of PD, see Tutorial 3. 

Before starting the analysis, think about this question:

<center>
**Why would PD be a better or worse measure of biodiversity when we consider the *Biodiversity-Ecosystem Function* relationship?**
</center>

To do this, we will:

   a) Calculate phylogenetic diversity in each community using a phylogeny comprised of genetic changes between lineages
   b) Add these results to our table of species richness and AAB in each plot from last week
   c) Run a linear regression of $AAB \sim PD$ 
   d) Compare the linear regression of $AAB \sim PD$ with those from last week, $AAB \sim Richness$ and $AAB \sim ln(Richness)$ using outputs from the linear regression
   e) Re-calculate PD after calibrating the phylogenetic tree to represent chronological time

### BEF analysis: Step-by-step

1. Load the `ape` or `picante` library into R. Re-use your code from Tutorial 3 (Introduction to Phylogenetic Diversity in R) if you're stuck. 

2. Along with the data frame and code from last week, make sure you load the phylogenetic tree, `phylogeny.phy`. 
This phylogenetic tree does not measure time like the `owls.tre` phylogeny we looked at in Tutorial 3. 
It is not an ultrametric tree (i.e. a tree in which the distances from the root to every branch tip are equal). 
Instead, this phylogenetic tree measures evolutionary divergence of lineages through genetic substitutions of base pairs in chloroplast genes.

<center>
**How might our analysis of PD change knowing that the genes used to construct the phylogeny are non-nuclear?**
</center>

3. Plot the phylogenetic tree. 
Do you notice anything odd about it?

4. We're going to start by calculating only PD for the `X2` plot.  
Subset the data in the same way as last week to create a table of only `X2` observations. 

5. Create a phylogenetic tree that only includes species that were found in `X2` **and the OUTGROUP** species! 
Review the code from Tutorial 3 if you are stuck; we have already written code that can do this for us. 
The species to include in the phylogenetic tree are those which were observed in the first year of observations.

<center>
**Why do we need to include an OUTGROUP species? Hint: what would a phylogenetic tree for a 1-species community look like?**
</center>

6. Calculate PD from this phylogenetic tree of a plot's species and the outgroup. 

7. Repeat this for each plot. 
You can now either modify your existing `for(...)` loop from last week, or you can write a new `for(...)` loop just to create phylogenetic trees and calculate PD for each plot one-at-a-time. 

8. Add the PD calculations to the results data frame that we used to store species richness and AAB from last week's code. 

9. Create and run a linear model that predicts AAB as a function of PD in each plot. 
    
10. Plot the relationship between PD and AAB with a scatterplot and overlay the linear regression created in Step 9. 

11. Interpret this relationships and compare the PD results with those from the linear regression of AAB against species richness.
How do the coefficients and intercepts compare between the linear models of species richness and PD? 
Using model outputs, which description of biodiversity (SR, ln(SR), or PD) best predicts AAB?

12. For your assignment, you will also need to create a new phylogenetic tree. 
The phylogenetic tree is based on the number of genetic substitutions in a few selected genes. 
Use the `chronoMPL()` and save its results to a new phylogenetic tree.

14. Repeat Steps 3-11 with the new phylogenetic tree, and compare which measure of phylogenetic distance - time or substitutions - is a better predictor of AAB. 

15. Write up your observations to answer the questions posted on Canvas in the Tutorial 6 - Biodiversity & Ecosystem Function pt 2 folder. Instructions are on the last slide of the [BIOL416 T5.pdf](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/18228/pages/tutorial-5-biodiversity-and-ecosystem-function?module_item_id=1032074)
